# OOP Shooty Mc Beard Face game

During a two day hackathon, my teammate and I started planning thinking of an interesting and fun game to play. We came up with the concept of Shooty Mc Bear Face and begun. We first made a detailed plan of what classes we will have, what states they will contain and what their behaviours will be. We then started coding and iterating over the plan in an agile fashion. We faced some issues such as creating a computer player for the user to play against and it was solved changing the position of the computer player randomly then writing out some logic regarding what would happen when the bullets touch either player or the obstacles in the map. We used Math.max to limit the playerâ€™s health and also gave the player the capability to move around the map using x and y positions in the Canvas and also to shoot with the left mouse button. We finished our MVP within the time frame given to us. [View project](https://shooty-mc-beard-face.netlify.app).
